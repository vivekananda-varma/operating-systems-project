# Operating-Systems-Project
A dynamic and improved implementation of bankers algorithm.

In this project an approach for Dynamic bankerâ€™s algorithm is proposed and has been implemented. The algorithm performs the process arrangement on the basis of their need resources that leads to solve the processes in less time. If the processes to be executed are high in number then classic bankers algorithm takes a lot of time if resources are not allocated ontime. So this dynamic approach will fasten up the process when there are many processes. 

THE CODE FOR THIS PROJECT IS THERE IN project.c FILE AND DOCUMENTATION IN project_file FILE..

The algorithm and proposed approach are explained in documentation file..
